#Smashdatcat

Just a simple Javascript mini game if you're bored.
After working on the dancing cats (http://charliegerard.github.io/dancingcats), I thought I would create a game in which you can shoot cats if you don't like them.

##TODO:

* Make the player lose if a cat goes off-screen.
* Make something happen if the player reaches 50 points. 
* Add some butterflies that you need to avoid (cause you don't shoot butterflies).
